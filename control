 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLEX TO THEOS FROM IPADKID358 AND MINE 
 
 V0.3.8 - I fixed the following bugs that were present in ipadkid358's version of flex to theos, but I hadn't gotten around to fixing until now 
 
 • Fixed a bug that would try to return %orig; on a void method 
 
 • If the output folder already exists, it will change the number on the end instead of failing to convert the project from flex to theos 
 
 • Ability to set FINALPACKAGE: && DEBUG: automatically when generating the makefile. 
 
 • Added ability to convert ALL flex patches to theos code projects with one command (ftt -z) 
 
 PAST FLEX TO THEOS UPDATES 
 
 • Fix bug that would add an extra character between the return value, causing the project not to make properly 
 
 • (bool) <- two characters Added the ability to make the deb straight from flex to theos terminal output (ftt -m) 
 
 • I have ftt -g hooked to some of my personal flex patches 
 
 • Added a preference bundle which allows the user to set custom arm support for their deb as well as customize the developers name / email and bundle name 
 
 • Added the ability to add a description to your patch straight from the terminal while using ftt 
 
 • Added ability to automatically name the folder after the flex patch you're making (ftt -a)
